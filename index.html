    <h1>Welcome to My Quantum Tunneling Simulation</h1>
    <p>This project simulates quantum tunneling using a Schrödinger equation.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Quantum Tunneling?</h2>
    <p>Quantum tunneling is a phenomenon where particles pass through a potential barrier, even if they don’t have enough energy to overcome it. This happens due to the wave-like nature of particles in quantum mechanics.</p>

    <h2>Try the Simulation!</h2>
    <p>The simulation uses the Schrödinger equation to calculate the behavior of an electron interacting with a potential barrier. Check out the interactive graph below:</p>
